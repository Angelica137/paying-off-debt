# Pay off your credit card

This is problem set 2 of MITx 600

### Problem 1 - Paying Debt off in a Year

Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

The following variables contain values as described below:

balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card

annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

monthlyPaymentRate - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal

For each month, calculate statements on the monthly payment and remaining balance. At the end of 12 months, print out the remaining balance. Be sure to print out no more than two decimal digits of accuracy - so print

### Problem 2 - Paying Debt Off in a Year

Write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month.

In this problem, we will not be dealing with a minimum monthly payment rate.

The following variables contain values as described below:

balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card

annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

The program should print out one line: the lowest monthly payment that will pay off all debt in under 1 year.
